## Issue to Create: Address clippy warnings and re-enable strict linting

**Title:** Address clippy warnings and re-enable strict linting

**Description:**
Currently, clippy is configured to only warn (not error) to avoid CI failures. There are several warnings that should be addressed, then clippy should be reconfigured to treat warnings as errors for better code quality.

**Key warnings to fix:**
- Collapsible if statements in `src/compute.rs:108`
- Missing Default trait for `GithubClient` in `src/github.rs:30`
- Large error types in `src/instance.rs:54`
- Too many arguments in `src/instance.rs:86`
- Unnecessary borrowing in multiple locations
- Inefficient iterator usage in `src/metadata.rs:50`
- Many unused crate dependencies

**Action items:**
- [ ] Fix all clippy warnings
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies from Cargo.toml or add appropriate `use` statements  
- [ ] Update CI configuration to treat clippy warnings as errors
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass after fixes

**Labels:** enhancement, code-quality
